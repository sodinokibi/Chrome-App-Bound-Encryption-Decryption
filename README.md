A post-exploitation tool demonstrating a complete, in-memory bypass of Chromium's **App-Bound Encryption (ABE)**. This project utilizes **Direct Syscall-based Reflective Process Hollowing** to launch a legitimate browser process in a suspended state, stealthily injecting a payload to hijack its identity and security context. This **Living-off-the-Land (LOTL)** technique that subverts the browser's own security model. The fileless approach allows the tool to operate entirely from memory, bypassing user-land API hooks to decrypt and exfiltrate sensitive user data (cookies, passwords, payments) from modern Chromium browsers.

## 🛡️ Core Technical Pillars

This tool's effectiveness is rooted in a combination of modern, evasion-focused techniques:

- **Direct Syscalls for Evasion:** Bypasses EDR/AV user-land hooks on standard WinAPI functions by invoking kernel functions directly. The engine is robust and dynamically resolves syscall numbers at runtime, ensuring compatibility across Windows versions.

- **Direct Syscall-Based Process Hollowing:** A stealthy process creation and injection technique. Instead of injecting into a high-traffic, potentially monitored process, it creates a new, suspended host process. This significantly reduces the chances of detection, as all memory manipulations occur before the process begins normal execution.

- **Fileless In-Memory Payload:** The payload DLL never touches the disk on the target machine. It is stored encrypted within the injector, decrypted in-memory, and reflectively loaded, minimizing its forensic footprint and bypassing static file-based scanners.

- **Reflective DLL Injection (RDI):** A stealthy process injection method that circumvents `LoadLibrary`, thereby evading detection mechanisms that monitor module loads. The self-contained C loader resolves all of its own dependencies from memory.

- **Target-Context COM Invocation:** The lynchpin for defeating App-Bound Encryption. By executing code _within_ the trusted browser process, we inherit its identity and security context, allowing us to make legitimate-appearing calls to the ABE COM server and satisfy its path-validation security checks.

## 🔬 Technical Workflow

The tool's execution is focused on stealth and efficiency, built around a **Direct Syscall-based Reflective Hollowing** process. This approach ensures that few high-level API calls are made and that the payload operates from within a legitimate, newly created browser process.

### **Stage 1: The Injector (`chromelevator.exe`)**

1.  **Pre-Flight & Initialization:** The injector begins by initializing its **direct syscall engine**, dynamically parsing `ntdll.dll` to resolve syscall numbers (SSNs) and locate kernel transition gadgets (`syscall/ret` or `svc/ret`). It then performs a critical pre-flight check, using `NtGetNextProcess` and other syscalls to find and terminate any browser "network service" child processes. This preemptively releases file locks on the target SQLite databases.
2.  **Payload Preparation:** The core payload DLL, which is stored as a **ChaCha20-encrypted resource**, is loaded and decrypted entirely in-memory.
3.  **Process Hollowing:** Instead of targeting an existing process, the injector creates a new instance of the target browser in a **`CREATE_SUSPENDED`** state (`CreateProcessW`). This pristine, suspended process serves as the host for our payload.
4.  **Reflective Injection via Syscalls:** Using the direct syscall engine, the injector performs a series of stealthy actions on the suspended process:
    - It allocates memory using `NtAllocateVirtualMemory`.
    - It writes the decrypted payload DLL into the allocated space with `NtWriteVirtualMemory`.
    - It changes the memory region's permissions to executable using `NtProtectVirtualMemory`.
    - It creates a **named pipe** for communication and writes the pipe's name into the target's memory.
5.  **Execution & Control:** A new thread is created in the target process using `NtCreateThreadEx`. The thread's start address points directly to the payload's `ReflectiveLoader` export, with the address of the remote pipe name as its argument. The original main thread of the browser remains suspended and is never resumed. The injector then waits for the payload to connect back to the pipe.

### **Stage 2: The Injected Payload (In-Memory)**

1.  **Bootstrapping:** The `ReflectiveLoader` stub executes, functioning as a custom in-memory PE loader. It correctly maps the DLL's sections, performs base relocations, and resolves its Import Address Table (IAT) by parsing the PEB and hashing function names. Finally, it invokes the payload's `DllMain`.
2.  **Connection & Setup:** The `DllMain` spawns a new thread that immediately connects to the named pipe handle passed by the injector. It reads the configuration, including the output path, sent by the injector. All subsequent logs and status updates are relayed back through this pipe.
3.  **Target-Context COM Hijack:** Now running natively within the browser process, the payload instantiates the browser's internal `IOriginalBaseElevator` or `IEdgeElevatorFinal` COM server. As the call originates from a trusted process path, all of the server's security checks are passed.
4.  **Master Key Decryption:** The payload calls the `DecryptData` method on the COM interface, providing the `app_bound_encrypted_key` it reads from the `Local State` file. The COM server dutifully decrypts the key and returns the plaintext AES-256 master key to the payload.
5.  **Data Exfiltration:** Armed with the AES key, the payload enumerates all user profiles (`Default`, `Profile 1`, etc.). For each profile, it queries the relevant SQLite databases (`Cookies`, `Login Data`, `Web Data`), decrypts the data blobs using AES-256-GCM, and formats the secrets as JSON. The results are written directly to the output directory specified by the injector.
6.  **Shutdown:** After processing all profiles, the payload sends a completion signal to the injector over the pipe and calls `FreeLibraryAndExitThread` to clean up. The injector, upon receiving the signal, terminates the parent host process with `NtTerminateProcess`.

## 📂 Data Extraction

Once decryption completes, data is saved to the specified output path (defaulting to `.\output\` if not specified via `--output-path`). Files are organized as follows:

**Base Path:** `YOUR_CHOSEN_PATH` (e.g., `.\output\` or the path you provide)
**Structure:** <Base Path>/<BrowserName>/<ProfileName>/<data_type>.json

Example paths (assuming default output location):\*\*

- 🍪 **Cookies (Chrome Default profile):** .\output\Chrome\Default\cookies.json
- 🔑 **Passwords (Edge Profile 1):** .\output\Edge\Profile 1\passwords.json
- 💳 **Payment Methods (Brave Default profile):** .\output\Brave\Default\payments.json

Each password file is a JSON array of objects:

```json
[
  {
    "origin": "https://example.com/login",
    "username": "user@example.com",
    "password": "••••••••••"
  },
  {
    "origin": "https://another.example.com",
    "username": "another_user",
    "password": "••••••••••"
  }
  …
]
```

### 💳 Payment Method Extraction

Each payment file is a JSON array of objects:

```json
[
  {
    "name_on_card": "John Doe",
    "expiration_month": 12,
    "expiration_year": 2030,
    "card_number": "••••••••••1234",

  {
    "name_on_card": "Jane Smith",
    "expiration_month": 07,
    "expiration_year": 2028,
    "card_number": "••••••••••5678",
    "cvc": "•••"
  }
  …
]
```
